# Rust_Assesment

Question 1: Write a program to fetch data from any open source api and save it into db and after that get those data from db and print it. (use any database and any api of your choice).

Question 2: You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Question 3: Create a simple chat application with two nodes using libp2p library and save the chat in a file.

Question 4: Use rust to build a simple client that can run the two following commands.

./simple —mode=cache.

./simple —mode=read.

The cache mode should connect via socket for 10 seconds only, disconnect and print “cache complete” to terminal.

While the socket is running it should collect all USD prices of BTC that it can during the 10 second period. It should then use these prices to calculate an aggregate.

Save both the result of the aggregate and the data points used to create the aggregate to a file.

The read mode should simply read and print the file to screen.


# Running Solutions:

Open new terminal.

Change PATH according to the question number.

Run "cargo build" to compile the program.

Run "cargo run" to run the solution.
